    <h2>Fictional books</h2>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>Fiction, literature created from the imagination, not presented as fact, though it may be based on a true story
        or
        situation. Types of literature in the fiction genre include the novel, short story, and novella.
        The word is from the Latin fictiō, “the act of making, fashioning, or molding.”</p>

    <h2>Classic</h2>
    <br>
    <img id="Classic" src="Classic.jpeg">
    <br>
    <p>A classic is a book accepted as being exemplary or noteworthy. What makes a book "classic" is a concern that has
        occurred to various authors ranging from Italo Calvino to Mark Twain and the related questions of
        "Why Read the Classics?" and "What Is a Classic?" have been essayed by authors from different genres
        and eras (including Calvino, T. S. Eliot, Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve). The ability of a classic book to be
        reinterpreted, to seemingly be renewed in the interests of generations of readers succeeding its creation,
        is a theme that is seen in the writings of literary critics including Michael Dirda, Ezra Pound, and
        Sainte-Beuve.
        These books can be published as a collection (such as Great Books of the Western World, Modern Library, or
        Penguin
        Classics), or presented as a list, such as Harold Bloom's list of books that constitute the Western canon.
        Although the term is often associated with the Western canon, it can be applied to works of literature from
        all traditions, such as the Chinese classics or the Indian Vedas.</p>

    <h2>Horror</h2>
    <br>
    <img id="horror" src="horror.jpeg">
    <br>
    <p>Horror is a genre of speculative fiction which is intended to frighten, scare, or disgust. Literary historian
        J.
        A. Cuddon defined the horror story as "a piece of fiction in prose of variable length... which shocks, or even
        frightens
        the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing".
         Horror intends to create an eerie and frightening atmosphere for the reader.
        Horror is often divided into the psychological horror and supernatural horror sub-genres.
        Often the central menace of a work of horror fiction can be interpreted as a metaphor for the larger fears of a
        society. Prevalent elements include ghosts, demons, vampires, werewolves, ghouls, the Devil, witches, monsters,
        dystopian and apocalyptic worlds, serial killers, cannibalism, psychopaths, cults, dark magic, Satanism, the
        macabre,
        gore, and torture.</p>

    <h2>Action and Adventure</h2>
    <br>
    <img id="adventure" src="Adventre.jpeg">
    <br>
    <p>D'Ammassa argues that adventure stories make the element of danger the focus;
        hence he argues that Charles Dickens's novel A Tale of Two Cities is an adventure novel because the protagonists
        are
        in constant danger of being imprisoned or killed, whereas Dickens's Great Expectations is not because "Pip's
        encounter with the convict is an adventure, but that scene is only a device to advance the main plot, which is
        not truly an adventure.
        Action fiction is a form of genre fiction whose subject matter is characterized by
        emphasis on exciting action sequences. This does not always mean they exclude character
        development or story-telling. Action fiction is related to other forms of fiction, including
        action films, action games and analogous media in other formats such as manga and anime.
        It includes martial arts action, extreme sports action, car chases and vehicles, suspense action,
        and action comedy, with each focusing in more detail on its own type and flavor of action.
        It is usually possible to tell from the creative style of an action sequence, the emphasis of an
        entire work, so that, for example, the style of a combat sequence will indicate whether the entire work
        can be classified as action adventure, or a martial work. Action is mainly defined by a central focus
        on any kind of exciting movement.</p>
